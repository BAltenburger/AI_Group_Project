# AI_Group_Project

## Startup:

Make a virtual environment & pip install the requirements.txt
The ipynb should then run on its own. 
If you are training, run all cells & make sure to set a new save file for the model.
If you just want to evaluate model performance and have a trained model in the models folder, run cells starting after the model is loaded in using the correct model file.
